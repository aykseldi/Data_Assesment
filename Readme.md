3.	Design Decisions: 
While preparing annotation guideline, I tried to explain task step by step and be clear on what is expected to do. Also, I assumed that annotators will have basic computer literacy.

4.	Questions to Engineering Team
How long does it take an image to be downloaded and uploaded? 
Will annotators be provided internet access? 

5.	Estimation

Given that we want 1 million annotations and have a pool of 100 full-time annotators, an image can be processed for about 30 seconds. 10 seconds for downloading and uploading.  20 seconds to draw a box or boxes. It takes 500,000 minutes (8334 hours). In a 9-hour daily work, they will have break 10 minutes at every 50 minutes and 	60 minutes of lunch break. So, we will have 8x50= 400 minutes efficient time. All task can be accomplished in 12,5 days if everything goes well. Some annotators may not work due to illness or some other reasons. For that reason, most probably all task can be done in 14 days.
After 50 minutes work, 10 minute break should be compulsory for annotators. Also, they should not work more than 400 minutes a day since they may not focus their attention on the task.
